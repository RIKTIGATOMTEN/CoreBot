# database.yaml
# ======================
# Database configuration for SQLite
# This file configures your SQLite database location and behavior

database:
  # Path to your SQLite database folder
  # Can be absolute or relative to project root
  # Examples: ./database/, /var/data/myapp/, ../storage/
  path: ./database/
  
  # Name of the SQLite database file
  # Must end with .db extension
  name: bot.db
  
  # Journal mode controls how SQLite handles transactions
  # Options: delete, truncate, persist, memory, wal, off
  # - wal (Write-Ahead Logging): Best for concurrent reads/writes (recommended)
  # - delete: Traditional rollback journal (default SQLite behavior)
  # - memory: Keeps journal in memory (faster but less safe)
  journal_mode: wal
  
  # Synchronous mode controls disk sync behavior
  # Options: off, normal, full, extra (or 0, 1, 2, 3)
  # - off: Fastest, but risk of corruption on power loss
  # - normal: Good balance of safety and speed (recommended)
  # - full: Very safe, slower writes
  # - extra: Paranoid mode, slowest
  synchronous: normal
  
  # Enable debug logging for all database queries
  # WARNING: Very verbose! Only use during development
  debug: false
  
  # Enable foreign key constraints
  # Set to false if you need to disable FK checks temporarily
  foreign_keys: true
  
  # Cache size in pages (negative = KB, positive = pages)
  # -2000 = 2MB cache (recommended for small to medium apps)
  # -64000 = 64MB cache (for larger databases)
  cache_size: -2000
  
  # Where to store temporary tables and indices
  # Options: default, file, memory (or 0, 1, 2)
  # - memory: Faster temporary operations (recommended)
  # - file: Uses disk for temp storage
  temp_store: memory
